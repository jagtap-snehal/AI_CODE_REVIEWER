# AI_CODE_REVIEWER


This project is a Python application developed during my internship at Innomatics Research Labs. The AI-powered Code Reviewer uses Google's Generative AI to analyze Python code, detect bugs, and provide suggestions for improvement. It features an intuitive Streamlit interface where users can input their code and receive feedback.

Key Features

Code Analysis: Identifies potential bugs, errors, and logical issues in Python code. Bug Report: Provides detailed feedback on the issues found, including error type and possible causes. Code Fix: Suggests fixes or optimizations to improve the code. User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

Technologies Used

Python: Programming language used for the application.

Streamlit: Framework for building the interactive web interface.

Google Generative AI: The AI model used for code analysis and review.

dotenv: To securely handle API keys.
